Hi, I am Frederic, a research scientist with experience in Next Generation Sequencing data and statistical analysis on cancer genomics.

For the past 10 years, I have been working and developing applications on Next Generation Sequencing Data at
the [INSERM U1065 lab](http://www.unice.fr/c3m/), Nice (FR), the [University of Washington Genome Sciences](http://www.gs.washington.edu/), Seattle (USA) and the [Center for Advanced Studies, Research and Development in Sardinia](http://www.crs4.it/), Pula (IT).
