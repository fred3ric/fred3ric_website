## Motivation for this
I try set realistic and achievable goals for your portfolio and resume. I break down my point of interest and devs into smaller and manageable steps, such as small news on data techworld, selecting some of my best work samples, or writing a summary statement. Having clear and specific goals will help me track my progress, celebrate my achievements, and avoid feeling overwhelmed.
